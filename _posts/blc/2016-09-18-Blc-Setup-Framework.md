Actually, not so much things need to be changed in framework until now.  
You can just search `hsql` , and replace all of them to `mysql`.  
And setup your database information.  
!!! Important : the database information should be the test database.  
When you run mvn:install, it will create the table and so on.  
All database information setting in framework is just for test.  
It's nothing to do with the demo(web) project.
